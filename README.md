# The Maze Of Waze
- Ex3 OOP

### Introduction:

In This Project:
- develop the game "The Maze Of Waze"
which is based on assignment data and algorithmic data that underlies Assignment 2.
- Create *KML* Files - which record the game and can be viewed on Google Earth.


This project is based on building a real-time game of robots (objects) on a weighted graph and collecting fruits (objects) of numerical value ("coins") placed on the graph sides.\
**Game time:** 30-60 seconds.\

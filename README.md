# The Maze Of Waze

### Introduction:

In This Project:
- develop the game "the Wise Maze game"
which is based on assignment data and algorithmic data that underlies Assignment 2.
- Create *KML* Files - which record the game and can be viewed on Google Earth.


This project is based on building a real-time game of robots (objects) on a weighted graph and collecting fruits (objects) of numerical value ("coins") placed on the graph sides.\
**Game time:** 30-60 seconds.\
**Purpose of the game:** Obtain a maximum number of fruits that the robots collected together.

### How to play the game:

1. Choose level to play (0-23 options)\
2. Choose level to play

Two options:
- **Manually**

- **Automatic**
The robot will move by using an algorithm.
